Good
====

Slim yet handsome validation library.

Core features:

-  Simple
-  Customizable
-  Supports nested model validation
-  Error paths (which field contains the error)
-  User-friendly error messages
-  Internationalization!
-  `Robust <misc/performance/performance.md>`__: 10 000 validations per
   second
-  Python 2.7, 3.3+ compatible
-  100% documented and unit-tested

Inspired by the amazing
`alecthomas/voluptuous <https://github.com/alecthomas/voluptuous>`__ and
100% compatible with it. The whole internals have been reworked towards
readability and robustness. And yeah, the docs are now exhaustive :)

The rationale for a remake was to make it modular with a tiny core and
everything else built on top of that, ensure that all error messages are
user-friendly out of the box, and tweak the performance.

Voluptuous Drop-In Replacement
==============================

Despite Good is modelled after Voluptuous and is highly compatible,
there still are differences that would definitely break your project.

If you're not ready for such a change -- ``good.voluptuous`` is the
solution: compatibility layer for switching from `voluptuous
0.8.5 <https://github.com/alecthomas/voluptuous>`__ with 100%
compatibility.

This is a drop-in replacement that passes all voluptuous unit-tests and
hence should work perfectly. Here's how to use it

.. code:: python

    #from voluptuous import *  # no more
    from good.voluptuous import *  # replacement

    # .. and use it like before

Includes all the features and is absolutely compatible, except for the
error message texts, which became much more user-friendly :)

Migration steps:

1. Replace ``voluptuous`` imports with ``good.voluptuous``
2. Run your application tests and see how it behaves
3. Module by module, replace ``good.voluptuous`` with just ``good``,
   keeping the differences in mind.

Also note the small differences that are still present:

-  Settings for ``required`` and ``extra`` are not inherited by embedded
   mappings.

   If your top-level schema defines ``required=False``, embedded
   mappings will still have the default ``required=True``! And same with
   ``extra``.

-  Different error message texts, which are easier to understand :)
-  Raises ``Invalid`` rather than ``MultipleInvalid`` for rejected extra
   mapping keys (see ```Extra`` <#extra>`__)

Good luck! :)

Schema
======

Validation schema.

A schema is a Python structure where nodes are pattern-matched against
the corresponding values. It leverages the full flexibility of Python,
allowing you to match values, types, data structures and much more.

When a schema is created, it's compiled into a callable function which
does the validation, hence it does not need to analyze the schema every
time.

Once the Schema is defined, validation can be triggered by calling it:

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema

    schema = Schema({ 'a': str })
    # Test
    schema({ 'a': 'i am a valid string' })

The following rules exist:

1. **Literal**: plain value is validated with direct comparison
   (equality check):

   .. code:: python

       Schema(1)(1)  #-> 1
       Schema(1)(2)  #-> Invalid: Invalid value: expected 1, got 2

2. **Type**: type schema produces a strict ``type(v) == schema`` check
   on the input value:

   .. code:: python

       Schema(int)(1)    #-> 1
       Schema(int)(True)
       #-> Invalid: Wrong type: expected Integer number, got Boolean
       Schema(int)('1')
       #-> Invalid: Wrong type: expected Integer number, got Binary String

   For Python2, there is an exception for ``basestring``: it won't make
   strict type checks, but rather ``isinstance()``.

   For a relaxed ``isinstance()`` check, see ```Type`` <#type>`__
   validator.

3. **Enum**: `Python 3.4
   Enums <https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html>`__, or the
   backported `enum34 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34>`__.

   Tests whether the input value is a valid ``Enum`` value:

   .. code:: python

       from enum import Enum

       class Colors(Enum):
           RED = 0xFF0000
           GREEN = 0x00FF00
           BLUE = 0x0000FF

       schema = Schema(Colors)

       schema(0xFF0000)  #-> <Colors.RED: 0xFF0000>
       schema(Colors.RED)  #-> <Colors.RED: 0xFF0000>
       schema(123)
       #-> Invalid: Invalid Colors value, expected Colors, got 123

   Output is always an instance of the provided ``Enum`` type value.

4. **Callable**: is applied to the value and the result is used as the
   final value.

Callables should raise ```Invalid`` <#invalid>`__ errors in case of a
failure, however some generic error types are converted automatically:
see `Callables <#callables>`__.

In addition, validators are allowed to transform a value to the required
form. For instance, ```Coerce(int)`` <#coerce>`__ returns a callable
which will convert input values into ``int`` or fail.

\`\`\`python def CoerceInt(v): # naive Coerce(int) implementation return
int(v)

Schema(CoerceInt)(1) #-> 1 Schema(CoerceInt)('1') #-> 1
Schema(CoerceInt)('a') #-> Invalid: invalid literal for int(): expected
CoerceInt(), got a \`\`\`

5. **``Schema``**: a schema may contain sub-schemas:

   .. code:: python

       sub_schema = Schema(int)
       schema = Schema([None, sub_schema])

       schema([None, 1, 2])  #-> [None, 1, 2]
       schema([None, '1'])  #-> Invalid: invalid value

   Since ``Schema`` is callable, validation transparently by just
   calling it :)

Moreover, instances of the following types are converted to callables on
the compilation phase:

1. **Iterables** (``list``, ``tuple``, ``set``, custom iterables):

   Iterables are treated as a set of valid values, where each value in
   the input is compared against each value in the schema.

   In order for the input to be valid, it needs to have the same
   iterable type, and all of its values should have at least one
   matching value in the schema.

   .. code:: python

       schema = Schema([1, 2, 3])  # List of valid values

       schema([1, 2, 2])  #-> [1, 2, 2]
       schema([1, 2, 4])  #-> Invalid: Invalid value @ [2]: expected List[1|2|3], got 4
       schema((1, 2, 2))  #-> Invalid: Wrong value type: expected List, got Tuple

   Each value within the iterable is a schema as well, and validation
   requires that each member of the input value matches *any* of the
   schemas. Thus, an iterable is a way to define *OR* validation rule
   for every member of the iterable:

   .. code:: python

       Schema([ # All values should be
           # .. int ..
           int,
           # .. or a string, casted to int ..
           lambda v: int(v)
       ])([ 1, 2, '3' ])  #-> [ 1, 2, 3 ]

   This example works like this:

   1. Validate that the input value has the matching type: ``list`` in
      this case
   2. For every member of the list, test that there is a matching value
      in the schema.

      E.g. for value ``1`` -- ``int`` matches (immediate
      ``instanceof()`` check). However, for value ``'3'`` -- ``int``
      fails, but the callable manages to do it with no errors, and
      transforms the value as well.

      Since lists are ordered, the first schema that didn't fail is
      used.

2. **Mappings** (``dict``, custom mappings):

   Each key-value pair in the input mapping is validated against the
   corresponding schema pair:

   .. code:: python

       Schema({
           'name': str,
           'age': lambda v: int(v)
       })({
           'name': 'Alex',
           'age': '18',
       })  #-> {'name': 'Alex', 'age': 18}

   When validating, *both* keys and values are schemas, which allows to
   use nested schemas and interesting validation rules. For instance,
   let's use ```In`` <#in>`__ validator to match certain keys:

   .. code:: python

       from good import Schema, In

       Schema({
           # These two keys should have integer values
           In('age', 'height'): int,
           # All other keys should have string values
           str: str,
       })({
           'age': 18,
           'height': 173,
           'name': 'Alex',
       })

   This works like this:

   1. Test that the input has a matching type (``dict``)
   2. For each key in the input mapping, matching keys are selected from
      the schema
   3. Validate input values with the corresponding value in the schema.

   In addition, certain keys can be marked as
   ```Required`` <#required>`__ and ```Optional`` <#optional>`__. The
   default behavior is to have all keys required, but this can be
   changed by providing ``default_keys=Optional`` argument to the
   Schema.

   Finally, a mapping does not allow any extra keys (keys not defined in
   the schema). To change this, provide ``extra_keys=Allow`` to the
   ``Schema`` constructor.

   Please note that ``default_keys`` and ``extra_keys`` settings do not
   propagate to sub-schemas and are only applied to the top-level
   mapping. If required, wrap sub-schemas with another ``Schema()`` and
   feed the settings, or use `Markers <#markers>`__ explicitly.

These are just the basic rules, and for sure ``Schema`` can do much more
than that! Additional logic is implemented through
`Markers <#markers>`__ and `Validators <#validation-tools>`__, which are
described in the following chapters.

Callables
---------

Finally, here are the things to consider when using custom callables for
validation:

-  Throwing errors.

   If the callable throws ```Invalid`` <#invalid>`__ exception, it's
   used as is with all the rich info it provides. Schema is smart enough
   to fill into most of the arguments (see
   ```Invalid.enrich`` <#invalidenrich>`__), so it's enough to use a
   custom message, and probably, set a human-friendly ``expected``
   field.

   In addition, specific error types are wrapped into ``Invalid``
   automatically: these are ``AssertionError``, ``TypeError``,
   ``ValueError``. Schema tries to do its best, but such messages will
   probably be cryptic for the user. Hence, always raise meaningful
   errors when creating custom validators. Still, this opens the
   possibility to use Python typecasting with validators like
   ``lambda v: int(v)``, since most of them are throwing ``TypeError``
   or ``ValueError``.

-  Naming.

   If the provided callable does not specify ``Invalid.expected``
   expected value, the ``__name__`` of the callable is be used instead.
   E.g. ``def intify(v):pass`` becomes ``'intify()'`` in reported
   errors.

   If a custom name is desired on the callable -- set the ``name``
   attribute on the callable object. This works best with classes,
   however a function can accept ``name`` attribute as well.

   For convenience, ```@message`` <#message>`__ and
   ```@name`` <#name>`__ decorators can be used on callables to specify
   the name and override the error message used when the validator
   fails.

-  Signals.

   A callable may decide that the value is soooo invalid that it should
   be dropped from the sanitized output. In this case, the callable
   should raise ``good.schema.signals.RemoveValue``.

   This is used by the ``Remove()`` marker, but can be leveraged by
   other callables as well.

Priorities
----------

Every schema type has a priority (`source <good/schema/util.py>`__),
which define the sequence for matching keys in a mapping schema:

1. Literals have highest priority
2. Types has lower priorities than literals, hence schemas can define
   specific rules for individual keys, and then declare general rules by
   type-matching:

   .. code:: python

       Schema({
           'name': str,  # Specific rule with a literal
           str: int,     # General rule with a type
       })

3. Callables, iterables, mappings -- have lower priorities.

In addition, `Markers <#markers>`__ have individual priorities, which
can be higher that literals (```Remove()`` <#remove>`__ marker) or lower
than callables (```Extra`` <#extra>`__ marker).

Creating a Schema
-----------------

.. code:: python

    Schema(schema, default_keys=None, extra_keys=None)

Creates a compiled ``Schema`` object from the given schema definition.

Under the hood, it uses ``SchemaCompiler``: see the
`source <good/schema/compiler.py>`__ if interested.

Arguments:

-  ``schema``: Schema definition
-  ``default_keys``: Default mapping keys behavior: a
   ```Marker`` <#markers>`__ class used as a default on mapping keys
   which are not Marker()ed with anything.

   Defaults to ``markers.Required``.
-  ``extra_keys``: Default extra keys behavior: sub-schema, or a
   ```Marker`` <#markers>`__ class.

   Defaults to ``markers.Reject``

Throws:

-  ``SchemaError``: Schema compilation error

Validating
----------

.. code:: python

    Schema.__call__(value)

Having a ```Schema`` <#schema>`__, user input can be validated by
calling the Schema on the input value.

When called, the Schema will return sanitized value, or raise
exceptions.

Arguments:

-  ``value``: Input value to validate

Returns: ``None`` Sanitized value

Throws:

-  ``good.MultipleInvalid``: Validation error on multiple values. See
   ```MultipleInvalid`` <#multipleinvalid>`__.
-  ``good.Invalid``: Validation error on a single value. See
   ```Invalid`` <#invalid>`__.

Errors
======

Source: `good/schema/errors.py <good/schema/errors.py>`__

When `validating user input <#validating>`__, ```Schema`` <#schema>`__
collects all errors and throws these after the whole input value is
validated. This makes sure that you can report *all* errors at once.

With simple schemas, like ``Schema(int)``, only a single error is
available: e.g. wrong value type. In this case,
```Invalid`` <#invalid>`__ error is raised.

However, with complex schemas with embedded structures and such,
multiple errors can occur: then [``MultipleInvalid``\ ] is reported.

All errors are available right at the top-level:

.. code:: python

    from good import Invalid, MultipleInvalid

Invalid
-------

.. code:: python

    Invalid(message, expected=None, provided=None, path=None,
            validator=None, **info)

Validation error for a single value.

This exception is guaranteed to contain text values which are meaningful
for the user.

Arguments:

-  ``message``: Validation error message.
-  ``expected``: Expected value: info about the value the validator was
   expecting.

   If validator does not specify it -- the name of the validator is
   used.
-  ``provided``: Provided value: info about the value that was actually
   supplied by the user

   If validator does not specify it -- the input value is typecasted to
   string and stored here.
-  ``path``: Path to the error value.

   E.g. if an invalid value was encountered at ['a'].b[1], then
   path=['a', 'b', 1].
-  ``validator``: The validator that has failed: a schema item
-  ``**info``: Custom values that might be provided by the validator. No
   built-in validator uses this.

``Invalid.enrich()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Invalid.enrich(expected=None, provided=None, path=None,
                   validator=None)

Enrich this error with additional information.

This works with both Invalid and MultipleInvalid (thanks to ``Invalid``
being iterable): in the latter case, the defaults are applied to all
collected errors.

The specified arguments are only set on ``Invalid`` errors which do not
have any value on the property.

One exclusion is ``path``: if provided, it is prepended to
``Invalid.path``. This feature is especially useful when validating the
whole input with multiple different schemas:

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Invalid

    schema = Schema(int)
    input = {
        'user': {
            'age': 10,
        }
    }

    try:
        schema(input['user']['age'])
    except Invalid as e:
        e.enrich(path=['user', 'age'])  # Make the path reflect the reality
        raise  # re-raise the error with updated fields

This is used when validating a value within a container.

Arguments:

-  ``expected``: Invalid.expected default
-  ``provided``: Invalid.provided default
-  ``path``: Prefix to prepend to Invalid.path
-  ``validator``: Invalid.validator default

Returns: ``Invalid|MultipleInvalid``

MultipleInvalid
---------------

.. code:: python

    MultipleInvalid(errors)

Validation errors for multiple values.

This error is raised when the ```Schema`` <#schema>`__ has reported
multiple errors, e.g. for several dictionary keys.

``MultipleInvalid`` has the same attributes as
```Invalid`` <#invalid>`__, but the values are taken from the first
error in the list.

In addition, it has the ``errors`` attribute, which is a list of
```Invalid`` <#invalid>`__ errors collected by the schema. The list is
guaranteed to be plain: e.g. there will be no underlying hierarchy of
``MultipleInvalid``.

Note that both ``Invalid`` and ``MultipleInvalid`` are iterable, which
allows to process them in singularity:

.. code:: python

    try:
        schema(input_value)
    except Invalid as ee:
        reported_problems = {}
        for e in ee:  # Iterate over `Invalid`
            path_str = u'.'.join(e.path)  # 'a.b.c.d', JavaScript-friendly :)
            reported_problems[path_str] = e.message
        #.. send reported_problems to the user

In this example, we create a dictionary of paths (as strings) mapped to
error strings for the user.

Arguments:

-  ``errors``: The reported errors.

   If it contains ``MultipleInvalid`` errors -- the list is recursively
   flattened so all of them are guaranteed to be instances of
   ```Invalid`` <#invalid>`__.

Markers
=======

A *Marker* is a proxy class which wraps some schema.

Immediately, the example is:

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Required

    Schema({
        'name': str,  # required key
        Optional('age'): int,  # optional key
    }, default_keys=Required)

This way, keys marked with ``Required()`` will report errors if no value
if provided.

Typically, a marker "decorates" a mapping key, but some of them can be
"standalone":

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Extra
    Schema({
        'name': str,
        Extra: int  # allow any keys, provided their values are integer
    })

Each marker can have it's own unique behavior since nothing is hardcoded
into the core ```Schema`` <#schema>`__. Keep on reading to learn how
markers perform.

``Required``
------------

.. code:: python

    Required(key)

``Required(key)`` is used to decorate mapping keys and hence specify
that these keys must always be present in the input mapping.

When compiled, ```Schema`` <#schema>`__ uses ``default_keys`` as the
default marker:

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Required

    schema = Schema({
        'name': str,
        'age': int
    }, default_keys=Required)  # wrap with Required() by default

    schema({'name': 'Mark'})
    #-> Invalid: Required key not provided @ ['age']: expected age, got -none-

Remember that mapping keys are schemas as well, and ``Require`` will
expect to always have a match:

.. code:: python

    schema = Schema({
        Required(str): int,
    })

    schema({})  # no `str` keys provided
    #-> Invalid: Required key not provided: expected String, got -none-

In addition, the ``Required`` marker has special behavior with
```Default`` <#default>`__ that allows to set the key to a default value
if the key was not provided. More details in the docs for
```Default`` <#default>`__.

Arguments:

``Optional``
------------

.. code:: python

    Optional(key)

``Optional(key)`` is controversial to ```Required(key)`` <#required>`__:
specified that the mapping key is not required.

This only has meaning when a ```Schema`` <#schema>`__ has
``default_keys=Required``: then, it decorates all keys with
``Required()``, unless a key is already decorated with some Marker.
``Optional()`` steps in: those keys are already decorated and hence are
not wrapped with ``Required()``.

So, it's only used to prevent ``Schema`` from putting ``Required()`` on
a key. In all other senses, it has absolutely no special behavior.

As a result, optional key can be missing, but if it was provided -- its
value must match the value schema.

Example: use as ``default_keys``:

.. code:: python

    schema = Schema({
        'name': str,
        'age': int
    }, default_keys=Optional)  # Make all keys optional by default

    schema({})  #-> {} -- okay
    schema({'name': None})
    #->  Invalid: Wrong type @ ['name']: expected String, got None

Example: use to mark specific keys are not required:

.. code:: python

    schema = Schema({
        'name': str,
        Optional(str): int  # key is optional
    })

    schema({'name': 'Mark'})  # valid
    schema({'name': 'Mark', 'age': 10})  # valid
    schema({'name': 'Mark', 'age': 'X'})
    #-> Invalid: Wrong type @ ['age']: expected Integer number, got Binary String

Arguments:

``Remove``
----------

.. code:: python

    Remove(key)

``Remove(key)`` marker is used to declare that the key, if encountered,
should be removed, without validating the value.

``Remove`` has highest priority, so it operates before everything else
in the schema.

Example:

.. code:: python

    schema = Schema({
        Remove('name'): str, # `str` does not mean anything since the key is removed anyway
        'age': int
    })

    schema({'name': 111, 'age': 18})  #-> {'age': 18}

However, it's more natural to use ``Remove()`` on values. Remember that
in this case ``'name'`` will become ```Required()`` <#required>`__, if
not decorated with ```Optional()`` <#optional>`__:

.. code:: python

    schema = Schema({
        Optional('name'): Remove
    })

    schema({'name': 111, 'age': 18})  #-> {'age': 18}

**Bonus**: ``Remove()`` can be used in iterables as well:

.. code:: python

    schema = Schema([str, Remove(int)])
    schema(['a', 'b', 1, 2])  #-> ['a', 'b']

Arguments:

``Reject``
----------

.. code:: python

    Reject(key)

``Reject(key)`` marker is used to report ```Invalid`` <#invalid>`__
errors every time is matches something in the input.

It has lower priority than most of other schemas, so rejection will only
happen if no other schemas has matched this value.

Example:

.. code:: python

    schema = Schema({
        Reject('name'): None,  # Reject by key
        Optional('age'): Msg(Reject, u"Field is not supported anymore"), # alternative form
    })

    schema({'name': 111})
    #-> Invalid: Field is not supported anymore @ ['name']: expected -none-, got name

Arguments:

``Allow``
---------

.. code:: python

    Allow(key)

``Allow(key)`` is a no-op marker that never complains on anything.

Designed to be used with ```Extra`` <#extra>`__.

Arguments:

``Extra``
---------

.. code:: python

    Extra(key)

``Extra`` is a catch-all marker to define the behavior for mapping keys
not defined in the schema.

It has the lowest priority, and delegates its function to its value,
which can be a schema, or another marker.

Given without argument, it's compiled with an identity function
``lambda x:x`` which is a catch-all: it matches any value. Together with
lowest priority, ``Extra`` will only catch values which did not match
anything else.

Every mapping has an ``Extra`` implicitly, and ``extra_keys`` argument
controls the default behavior.

Example with ``Extra: <schema>``:

.. code:: python

    schema = Schema({
        'name': str,
        Extra: int  # this will allow extra keys provided they're int
    })

    schema({'name': 'Alex', 'age': 18'})  #-> ok
    schema({'name': 'Alex', 'age': 'X'})
    #-> Invalid: Wrong type @ ['age']: expected Integer number, got Binary String

Example with ``Extra: Reject``: reject all extra values:

.. code:: python

    schema = Schema({
        'name': str,
        Extra: Reject
    })

    schema({'name': 'Alex', 'age': 'X'})
    #-> Invalid: Extra keys not allowed @ ['age']: expected -none-, got age

Example with ``Extra: Remove``: silently discard all extra values:

.. code:: python

    schema = Schema({'name': str}, extra_keys=Remove)
    schema({'name': 'Alex', 'age': 'X'})  #-> {'name': 'Alex'}

Example with ``Extra: Allow``: allow any extra values:

.. code:: python

    schema = Schema({'name': str}, extra_keys=Allow)
    schema({'name': 'Alex', 'age': 'X'})  #-> {'name': 'Alex', 'age': 'X'}

Arguments:

``Entire``
----------

.. code:: python

    Entire(key)

``Entire`` is a convenience marker that validates the entire mapping
using validators provided as a value.

It has absolutely lowest priority, lower than ``Extra``, hence it never
matches any keys, but is still executed to validate the mapping itself.

This opens the possibilities to define rules on multiple fields. This
feature is leveraged by the ```Inclusive`` <#inclusive>`__ and
```Exclusive`` <#exclusive>`__ group validators.

For example, let's require the mapping to have no more than 3 keys:

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Entire

    def maxkeys(n):
        # Return a validator function
        def validator(d):
            # `d` is the dictionary.
            # Validate it
            assert len(d) <= 3, 'Dict size should be <= 3'
            # Return the value since all callable schemas should do that
            return d
        return validator

    schema = Schema({
        str: int,
        Entire: maxkeys(3)
    })

In this example, ``Entire`` is executed for every input dictionary, and
magically calls the schema it's mapped to. The ``maxkeys(n)`` schema is
a validator that complains on the dictionary size if it's too huge.
``Schema`` catches the ``AssertionError`` thrown by it and converts it
to ```Invalid`` <#invalid>`__.

Note that the schema this marker is mapped to can't replace the mapping
object, but it can mutate the given mapping.

Arguments:

Validation Tools
================

All validators listed here inherit from ``ValidatorBase`` which defines
the standard interface. Currently it makes no difference whether it's
just a callable, a class, or a subclass of ``ValidatorBase``, but in the
future it may gain special features.

Helpers
-------

Collection of miscellaneous helpers to alter the validation process.

``Object``
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Object(schema, cls=None)

Specify that the provided mapping should validate an object.

This uses the same mapping validation rules, but works with attributes
instead:

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Object

    intify = lambda v: int(v)  # Naive Coerce(int) implementation

    # Define a class to play with
    class Person(object):
        category = u'Something'  # Not validated

        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age

    # Schema
    schema = Schema(Object({
        'name': str,
        'age': intify,
    }))

    # Validate
    schema(Person(name=u'Alex', age='18'))  #-> Girl(name=u'Alex', age=18)

Internally, it validates the object's ``__dict__``: hence, class
attributes are excluded from validation. Validation is performed with
the help of a wrapper class which proxies object attributes as mapping
keys, and then Schema validates it as a mapping.

This inherits the default required/extra keys behavior of the Schema. To
override, use ```Optional()`` <#optional>`__ and ```Extra`` <#extra>`__
markers.

Arguments:

-  ``schema``: Object schema, given as a mapping
-  ``cls``: Require instances of a specific class. If ``None``, allows
   all classes.

``Msg``
~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Msg(schema, message)

Override the error message reported by the wrapped schema in case of
validation errors.

On validation, if the schema throws ```Invalid`` <#invalid>`__ -- the
message is overridden with ``msg``.

Some other error types are converted to ``Invalid``: see notes on
`Schema Callables <#callables>`__.

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Msg

    intify = lambda v: int(v)  # Naive Coerce(int) implementation
    intify.name = u'Number'

    schema = Schema(Msg(intify, u'Need a number'))
    schema(1)  #-> 1
    schema('a')
    #-> Invalid: Need a number: expected Number, got a

Arguments:

-  ``schema``: The wrapped schema to modify the error for
-  ``message``: Error message to use instead of the one that's reported
   by the underlying schema

``Test``
~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Test(fun)

Test the value with the provided function, expecting that it won't throw
errors.

If no errors were thrown -- the value is valid and *the original input
value is used*. If any error was thrown -- the value is considered
invalid.

This is especially useful to discard tranformations made by the wrapped
validator:

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Coerce

    schema = Schema(Coerce(int))

    schema(123)  #-> 123
    schema('123')  #-> '123' -- still string
    schema('abc')
    #-> Invalid: Invalid value, expected *Integer number, got abc

Arguments:

-  ``fun``: Callable to test the value with, or a validator function.

   Note that this won't work with mutable input values since they're
   modified in-place!

``message``
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    message(message, name=None)

Convenience decorator that applies ```Msg()`` <#msg>`__ to a callable.

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, message

    @message(u'Need a number')
    def intify(v):
        return int(v)

Arguments:

-  ``message``: Error message to use instead
-  ``name``: Override schema name as well. See ```name`` <#name>`__.

Returns: ``callable`` decorator

``name``
~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    name(name, validator=None)

Set a name on a validator callable.

Useful for user-friendly reporting when using lambdas to populate the
```Invalid.expected`` <#invalid>`__ field:

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, name

    Schema(lambda x: int(x))('a')
    #-> Invalid: invalid literal for int(): expected <lambda>(), got
    Schema(name('int()', lambda x: int(x))('a')
    #-> Invalid: invalid literal for int(): expected int(), got a

Note that it is only useful with lambdas, since function name is used if
available: see notes on `Schema Callables <#callables>`__.

Arguments:

-  ``name``: Name to assign on the validator callable
-  ``validator``: Validator callable. If not provided -- a decorator is
   returned instead:

   .. code:: python

       from good import name

       @name(u'int()')
       def int(v):
           return int(v)

Returns: ``callable`` The same validator callable

``truth``
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    truth(message, expected=None)

Convenience decorator that applies ```Check`` <#check>`__ to a callable.

.. code:: python

    from good import truth

    @truth(u'Must be an existing directory')
    def isDir(v):
        return os.path.isdir(v)

Arguments:

-  ``message``: Validation error message
-  ``expected``: Expected value string representation, or ``None`` to
   get it from the wrapped callable

Returns: ``callable`` decorator

Predicates
----------

``Maybe``
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Maybe(schema, none=None)

Validate the the value either matches the given schema or is None.

This supports *nullable* values and gives them a good representation.

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Maybe, Email

    schema = Schema(Maybe(Email))

    schema(None)  #-> None
    schema('user@example.com')  #-> 'user@example.com'
    scheam('blahblah')
    #-> Invalid: Wrong E-Mail: expected E-Mail?, got blahblah

Note that it also have the ```Default``-like behavior <#default>`__ that
initializes the missing ```Required()`` <#required>`__ keys:

.. code:: python

    schema = Schema({
        'email': Maybe(Email)
    })

    schema({})  #-> {'email': None}

Arguments:

-  ``schema``: Schema for a provided value
-  ``none``: Empty value literal

``Any``
~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Any(*schemas)

Try the provided schemas in order and use the first one that succeeds.

This is the *OR* condition predicate: any of the schemas should match.
```Invalid`` <#invalid>`__ error is reported if neither of the schemas
has matched.

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Any

    schema = Schema(Any(
        # allowed string constants
        'true', 'false',
        # otherwise coerce as a bool
        lambda v: 'true' if v else 'false'
    ))
    schema('true')  #-> 'true'
    schema(0)  #-> 'false'

Arguments:

-  ``*schemas``: List of schemas to try.

``All``
~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    All(*schemas)

Value must pass all validators wrapped with ``All()`` predicate.

This is the *AND* condition predicate: all of the schemas should match
in order, which is in fact a composition of validators:
``All(f,g)(value) = g(f(value))``.

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, All, Range

    schema = Schema(All(
        # Must be an integer ..
        int,
        # .. and in the allowed range
        Range(0, 10)
    ))

    schema(1)  #-> 1
    schema(99)
    #-> Invalid: Not in range: expected 0..10, got 99

Arguments:

-  ``*schemas``: List of schemas to apply.

``Neither``
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Neither(*schemas)

Value must not match any of the schemas.

This is the *NOT* condition predicate: a value is considered valid if
each schema has raised an error.

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, All, Neither

    schema = Schema(All(
        # Integer
        int,
        # But not zero
        Neither(0)
    ))

    schema(1)  #-> 1
    schema(0)
    #-> Invalid: Value not allowed: expected Not(0), got 0

Arguments:

-  ``*schemas``: List of schemas to check against.

``Inclusive``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Inclusive(*keys)

``Inclusive`` validates the defined inclusive group of mapping keys: if
any of them was provided -- then all of them become required.

This exists to support "sub-structures" within the mapping which only
make sense if specified together. Since this validator works on the
entire mapping, the best way is to use it together with the
```Entire`` <#entire>`__ marker:

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Entire, Inclusive

    schema = Schema({
        # Fields for all files
        'name': str,
        # Fields for images only
        Optional('width'): int,
        Optional('height'): int,
        # Now put a validator on the entire mapping
        Entire: Inclusive('width', 'height')
    })

    schema({'name': 'monica.jpg'})  #-> ok
    schema({'name': 'monica.jpg', 'width': 800, 'height': 600})  #-> ok
    schema({'name': 'monica.jpg', 'width': 800})
    #-> Invalid: Required key not provided: expected height, got -none-

Note that ``Inclusive`` only supports literals.

Arguments:

-  ``*keys``: List of mutually inclusive keys (literals).

``Exclusive``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Exclusive(*keys)

``Exclusive`` validates the defined exclusive group of mapping keys: if
any of them was provided -- then none of the remaining keys can be used.

This supports "sub-structures" with choice: if the user chooses a field
from one of them -- then he cannot use others. It works on the entire
mapping and hence best to use with the ```Entire`` <#entire>`__ marker.

By default, ``Exclusive`` requires the user to choose one of the
options, but this can be overridden with ```Optional`` <#optional>`__
marker class given as an argument:

.. code:: python

    from good import Exclusive, Required, Optional

    # Requires either of them
    Exclusive('login', 'password')
    Exclusive(Required, 'login', 'password')  # the default

    # Requires either of them, or none
    Exclusive(Optional, 'login', 'password')

Let's demonstrate with the API that supports multiple types of
authentication, but requires the user to choose just one:

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Entire, Exclusive

    schema = Schema({
        # Authentication types: login+password | email+password
        Optional('login'): str,
        Optional('email'): str,
        'password': str,
        # Now put a validator on the entire mapping
        # that forces the user to choose
        Entire: Msg(  # also override the message
            Exclusive('login', 'email'),
            u'Choose one'
        )
    })

    schema({'login': 'kolypto', 'password': 'qwerty'})  #-> ok
    schema({'email': 'kolypto', 'password': 'qwerty'})  #-> ok
    schema({'login': 'a', 'email': 'b', 'password': 'c'})
    #-> MultipleInvalid:
    #->     Invalid: Choose one @ [login]: expected login|email, got login
    #->     Invalid: Choose one @ [email]: expected login|email, got email

Note that ``Exclusive`` only supports literals.

Arguments:

-  ``*keys``: List of mutually exclusive keys (literals).

   Can contain ```Required`` <#required>`__ or
   ```Optional`` <#optional>`__ marker classes, which defines the
   behavior when no keys are provided. Default is ``Required``.

Types
-----

``Type``
~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Type(*types)

Check if the value has the specific type with ``isinstance()`` check.

In contrast to `Schema types <#schema>`__ which performs a strict check,
this check is relaxed and accepts subtypes as well.

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Type

    schema = Schema(Type(int))
    schema(1)  #-> 1
    schema(True)  #-> True

Arguments:

-  ``*types``: The type to check instances against.

   If multiple types are provided, then any of them is acceptable.

``Coerce``
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Coerce(constructor)

Coerce a value to a type with the provided callable.

``Coerce`` applies the *constructor* to the input value and returns a
value cast to the provided type.

If *constructor* fails with ``TypeError`` or ``ValueError``, the value
is considered invalid and ``Coerce`` complains on that with a custom
message.

However, if *constructor* raises ```Invalid`` <#invalid>`__ -- the error
object is used as it.

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Coerce

    schema = Schema(Coerce(int))
    schema(u'1')  #-> 1
    schema(u'a')
    #-> Invalid: Invalid value: expected *Integer number, got a

Arguments:

-  ``constructor``: Callable that typecasts the input value

Values
------

``In``
~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    In(container)

Validate that a value is in a collection.

This is a plain simple ``value in container`` check, where ``container``
is a collection of literals.

In contrast to ```Any`` <#any>`__, it does not compile its arguments
into schemas, and hence achieves better performance.

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, In

    schema = Schema(In({1, 2, 3}))

    schema(1)  #-> 1
    schema(99)
    #-> Invalid: Unsupported value: expected In(1,2,3), got 99

The same example will work with ```Any`` <#any>`__, but slower :-)

Arguments:

-  ``container``: Collection of allowed values.

   In addition to naive tuple/list/set/dict, this can be any object that
   supports ``in`` operation.

``Length``
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Length(min=None, max=None)

Validate that the provided collection has length in a certain range.

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Length

    schema = Schema(All(
        # Ensure it's a list (and not any other iterable type)
        list,
        # Validate length
        Length(max=3),
    ))

Since mappings also have length, they can be validated as well:

.. code:: python

    schema = Schema({
        # Strings mapped to integers
        str: int,
        # Size = 1..3
        # Empty dicts are not allowed since `str` is implicitly `Required(str)`
        Entire: Length(max=3)
    })

    schema([1])  #-> ok
    schema([1,2,3,4])
    #-> Invalid: Too long (3 is the most): expected Length(..3), got 4

Arguments:

-  ``min``: Minimal allowed length, or ``None`` to impose no limits.
-  ``max``: Maximal allowed length, or ``None`` to impose no limits.

``Default``
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Default(default)

Initialize a value to a default if it's not provided.

"Not provided" means ``None``, so basically it replaces ``None``\ s with
the default:

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Any, Default

    schema = Schema(Any(
        # Accept ints
        int,
        # Replace `None` with 0
        Default(0)
    ))

    schema(1)  #-> 1
    schema(None)  #-> 0

It raises ```Invalid`` <#invalid>`__ on all values except for ``None``
and ``default``:

.. code:: python

    schema = Schema(Default(42))

    schema(42)  #-> 42
    schema(None)  #-> 42
    schema(1)
    #-> Invalid: Invalid value

In addition, ``Default`` has special behavior with ``Required`` marker
which is built into it: if a required key was not provided -- it's
created with the default value:

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Default

    schema = Schema({
        # remember that keys are implicitly required
        'name': str,
        'age': Any(int, Default(0))
    })

    schema({'name': 'Alex'})  #-> {'name': 'Alex', 'age': 0}

Arguments:

-  ``default``: The default value to use

``Fallback``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Fallback(default)

Always returns the default value.

Works like ```Default`` <#default>`__, but does not fail on any values.

Typical usage is to terminate ```Any`` <#any>`__ chain in case nothing
worked:

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Any, Fallback

    schema = Schema(Any(
        int,
        # All non-integer numbers are replaced with `None`
        Fallback(None)
    ))

Like ```Default`` <#default>`__, it also works with mappings.

Internally, ``Default`` and ``Fallback`` work by feeding the schema with
a special ```Undefined`` <good/schema/util.py>`__ value: if the schema
manages to return some value without errors -- then it has the named
"default behavior", and this validator just leverages the feature.

A "fallback value" may be provided manually, and will work absolutely
the same (since value schema manages to succeed even though
``Undefined`` was given):

.. code:: python

    schema = Schema({
        'name': str,
        'age': Any(int, lambda v: 42)
    })

Arguments:

-  ``default``: The value that's always returned

``Map``
~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Map(enum, mode=1)

Convert Enumerations that map names to values.

Supports three kinds of enumerations:

1. Mapping.

   Provided a mapping from names to values, converts the input to values
   by mapping key:

   .. code:: python

       from good import Schema, Map
       schema = Schema(Map({
           'RED': 0xFF0000,
           'GREEN': 0x00FF00,
           'BLUE': 0x0000FF
       }))

       schema('RED')  #-> 0xFF0000
       schema('BLACK')
       #-> Invalid: Unsupported value: expected Constant, provided BLACK

2. Class.

   Provided a class with attributes (names) initialized with values,
   converts the input to values matching by attribute name:

   .. code:: python

       class Colors:
           RED = 0xFF0000
           GREEN = 0x00FF00
           BLUE = 0x0000FF

       schema = Schema(Map(Colors))

       schema('RED')  #-> 0xFF0000
       schema('BLACK')
       #-> Invalid: Unsupported value: expected Colors, provided BLACK

   Note that all attributes of the class are used, except for protected
   (``_name``) and callables.

3. Enum.

   Supports `Python 3.4
   Enums <https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html>`__ and the
   backported `enum34 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34>`__.

   Provided an enumeration, converts the input to values by name. In
   addition, enumeration value can pass through safely:

   .. code:: python

       from enum import Enum

       class Colors(Enum):
           RED = 0xFF0000
           GREEN = 0x00FF00
           BLUE = 0x0000FF

       schema = Schema(Map(Colors))
       schema('RED')  #-> <Colors.RED: 0xFF0000>
       schema('BLACK')
       #-> Invalid: Unsupported value: expected Colors, provided BLACK

   Note that in ``mode=Map.VAL`` it works precisely like
   ``Schema(Enum)``.

In addition to the "straignt" mode (lookup by key), it supports reverse
matching:

-  When ``mode=Map.KEY``, does only forward matching (by key) -- the
   default
-  When ``mode=Map.VAL``, does only reverse matching (by value)
-  When ``mode=Map.BOTH``, does bidirectional matching (by key first,
   then by value)

Another neat feature is that ``Map`` supports ``in`` containment checks,
which works great together with ```In`` <#in>`__:
``In(Map(enum-value))`` will test if a value is convertible, but won't
actually do the convertion.

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Map, In

    schema = Schema(In(Map(Colors)))

    schema('RED') #-> 'RED'
    schema('BLACK')
    #-> Invalid: Unsupported value, expected Colors, got BLACK

Arguments:

-  ``enum``: Enumeration: dict, object, of Enum
-  ``mode``: Matching mode: one of Map.KEY, Map.VAL, Map.BOTH

Boolean
-------

``Check``
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Check(bvalidator, message, expected)

Use the provided boolean function as a validator and raise errors when
it's ``False``.

.. code:: python

    import os.path
    from good import Schema, Check

    schema = Schema(
        Check(os.path.isdir, u'Must be an existing directory'))
    schema('/')  #-> '/'
    schema('/404')
    #-> Invalid: Must be an existing directory: expected isDir(), got /404

Arguments:

-  ``bvalidator``: Boolean validator function
-  ``message``: Error message to report when ``False``
-  ``expected``: Expected value string representation, or ``None`` to
   get it from the wrapped callable

``Truthy``
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Truthy()

Assert that the value is truthy, in the Python sense.

This fails on all "falsy" values: ``False``, ``0``, empty collections,
etc.

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Truthy

    schema = Schema(Truthy())

    schema(1)  #-> 1
    schema([1,2,3])  #-> [1,2,3]
    schema(None)
    #-> Invalid: Empty value: expected truthy(), got None

``Falsy``
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Falsy()

Assert that the value is falsy, in the Python sense.

Supplementary to ```Truthy`` <#truthy>`__.

``Boolean``
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Boolean()

Convert human-readable boolean values to a ``bool``.

The following values are supported:

-  ``None``: ``False``
-  ``bool``: direct
-  ``int``: ``0`` = ``False``, everything else is ``True``
-  ``str``: Textual boolean values, compatible with `YAML 1.1 boolean
   literals <http://yaml.org/type/bool.html>`__, namely:

   ::

       y|Y|yes|Yes|YES|n|N|no|No|NO|
       true|True|TRUE|false|False|FALSE|
       on|On|ON|off|Off|OFF

   ```Invalid`` <#invalid>`__ is thrown if an unknown string literal is
   provided.

Example:

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, Boolean

    schema = Schema(Boolean())

    schema(None)  #-> False
    schema(0)  #-> False

Dates
-----

``DateTime``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    DateTime(formats, localize=None, astz=None)

Validate that the input is a Python ``datetime``.

Supports the following input values:

1. ``datetime``: passthrough
2. string: parses the string with any of the specified formats (see
   `strptime() <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior>`__)

.. code:: python

    from datetime import datetime
    from good import Schema, DateTime

    schema = Schema(DateTime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'))

    schema('2014-09-06 21:22:23')  #-> datetime.datetime(2014, 9, 6, 21, 22, 23)
    schema(datetime.now())  #-> datetime.datetime(2014, 9, 6, 21, 22, 23)
    schema('2014')
    #-> Invalid: Invalid datetime format, expected DateTime, got 2014.

Notes on timezones:

-  If the format does not support timezones, it always returns *naive*
   ``datetime`` objects (without ``tzinfo``).
-  If timezones are supported by the format (with ``%z``/``%Z``), it
   returns an *aware* ``datetime`` objects (with ``tzinfo``).
-  Since Python2 does not always support ``%z`` -- ``DateTime`` does
   this manually. Due to the limited nature of this workaround, the
   support for ``%z`` only works if it's at the end of the string!

As a result, '00:00:00' is parsed into a *naive* datetime, and '00:00:00
+0200' results in an *aware* datetime.

If your application wants different rules, use ``localize`` and
``astz``:

-  ``localize`` argument is the default timezone to set on *naive*
   datetimes, or a callable which is applied to the input and should
   return adjusted ``datetime``.
-  ``astz`` argument is the timezone to adjust the *aware* datetime to,
   or a callable.

Then the generic recipe is:

-  Set ``localize`` to the timezone (or a callable) that you expect the
   user to input the datetime in
-  Set ``astz`` to the timezone you wish to have in the result.

This works best with the excellent
`pytz <http://pytz.sourceforge.net/>`__ library:

.. code:: python

    import pytz
    from good import Schema, DateTime

    # Formats: with and without timezone
    formats = [
        '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S',
        '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%z'
    ]

    # The used timezones
    UTC = pytz.timezone('UTC')
    Oslo = pytz.timezone('Europe/Oslo')

    ### Example: Use Europe/Oslo by default
    schema = Schema(DateTime(
        formats,
        localize=Oslo
    ))

    schema('2014-01-01 00:00:00')
    #-> datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 1, 0, 0, tzinfo='Europe/Oslo')
    schema('2014-01-01 00:00:00-0100')
    #-> datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 1, 0, 0, tzinfo=-0100)

    ### Example: Use Europe/Oslo by default and convert to an aware UTC
    schema = Schema(DateTime(
        formats,
        localize=Oslo,
        astz=UTC
    ))

    schema('2014-01-01 00:00:00')
    #-> datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 31, 23, 17, tzinfo=<UTC>)
    schema('2014-01-01 00:00:00-0100')
    #-> datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 1, 1, 0, tzinfo=<UTC>)

    ### Example: Use Europe/Oslo by default, convert to a naive UTC
    # This is the recommended way
    schema = Schema(DateTime(
        formats,
        localize=Oslo,
        astz=lambda v: v.astimezone(UTC).replace(tzinfo=None)
    ))

    schema('2014-01-01 00:00:00')
    #-> datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 31, 23, 17)
    schema('2014-01-01 00:00:00-0100')
    #-> datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 1, 1, 0)

Note: to save some pain, make sure to *always* work with naive
``datetimes`` adjusted to UTC! Armin Ronacher `explains it
here <http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/7/15/eppur-si-muove/>`__.

Summarizing all the above, the validation procedure is a 3-step process:

1. Parse (only with strings)
2. If is *naive* -- apply ``localize`` and make it *aware* (if
   ``localize`` is specified)
3. If is *aware* -- apply ``astz`` to convert it (if ``astz`` is
   specified)

Arguments:

-  ``formats``: Supported format string, or an iterable of formats to
   try them all.
-  ``localize``: Adjust *naive* ``datetimes`` to a timezone, making it
   *aware*.

   A ``tzinfo`` timezone object, or a callable which is applied to a
   *naive* datetime and should return an adjusted value.

   Only called for *naive* ``datetime``\ s.
-  ``astz``: Adjust *aware* ``datetimes`` to another timezone.

   A ``tzinfo`` timezone object, or a callable which is applied to an
   *aware* datetime and should return an adjusted value.

   Only called for *aware* ``datetime``\ s, including those created by
   ``localize``

``Date``
~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Date(formats, localize=None, astz=None)

Validate that the input is a Python ``date``.

Supports the following input values:

1. ``date``: passthrough
2. ``datetime``: takes the ``.date()`` part
3. string: parses (see ```DateTime`` <#datetime>`__)

.. code:: python

    from datetime import date
    from good import Schema, Date

    schema = Schema(Date('%Y-%m-%d'))

    schema('2014-09-06')  #-> datetime.date(2014, 9, 6)
    schema(date(2014, 9, 6))  #-> datetime.date(2014, 9, 6)
    schema('2014')
    #-> Invalid: Invalid date format, expected Date, got 2014.

Arguments:

``Time``
~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Time(formats, localize=None, astz=None)

Validate that the input is a Python ``time``.

Supports the following input values:

1. ``time``: passthrough
2. ``datetime``: takes the ``.timetz()`` part
3. string: parses (see ```DateTime`` <#datetime>`__)

Since ``time`` is subject to timezone problems, make sure you've read
the notes in the relevant section of ```DateTime`` <#datetime>`__ docs.

Arguments:

.. code:: python

    IsFile()

.. code:: python

    from good import Schema, IsFile

    schema = Schema(IsFile())

    schema('/etc/hosts')  #-> '/etc/hosts'
    schema('/etc')
    #-> Invalid: is not a file: expected Existing file path, got /etc

``IsDir``
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    IsDir()

Verify that the directory exists.

``PathExists``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
